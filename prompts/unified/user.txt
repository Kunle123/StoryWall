Generate:
1. Anchor Style: Comprehensive visual guide (5-7 sentences) covering:
   - Visual Palette (colors, saturation, contrast, lighting)
   - Setting & Atmosphere (era, location, environment - LOCK to specific setting)
   - Character Archetype (if applicable - faceless mood doubles with exact physique/clothing/posture)
   - Emotional Tone (primary emotion and progression)
   - Cinematography (shot type, angles, lens, vignette){{#if themeColor}}
   - Incorporate {{themeColor}} as subtle accent{{/if}}
   
   CRITICAL: The Anchor Style must be GENERAL and apply to ALL events. DO NOT include specific event titles, event names, brand names, or event-specific content in the Anchor. The Anchor should describe the overall aesthetic for the timeline subject, NOT individual events.

2. Hashtags: Generate 5-10 relevant hashtags for this timeline (without # symbol, lowercase, single words or compound words like 'formula1', 'worldwar2'). Include:
   - Subject-specific tags (e.g., 'formula1', 'kubrick', 'renaissance')
   - Category tags (e.g., 'sport', 'film', 'art', 'history')
   - Topic tags (e.g., 'racing', 'cinema', 'painting')
   - Ensure tags are relevant to the timeline's subject matter

3. For each event:
   - Description: 2-4 sentences explaining the EVENT - what happened, why it matters, its historical/educational significance. The description should explain the event itself, NOT describe what the scene looks like. Focus on the event's meaning, impact, and context.
   - Image Prompt: Literal, recognizable scene that visually represents this event. After generating anchorStyle, prepend a 60-80 character preview of it to each imagePrompt (e.g., "ANCHOR: [preview]. [scene description]")

CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
- The DESCRIPTION explains the EVENT (what happened, why it matters, its significance)
- The IMAGE PROMPT describes the VISUAL SCENE (what you would see in an image of that event)
- They should be about the SAME event, but serve different purposes: description = explanation, imagePrompt = visual representation
