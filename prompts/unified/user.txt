Generate:
1. Anchor Style: Comprehensive visual guide (5-7 sentences) covering:
   - Visual Palette (colors, saturation, contrast, lighting)
   - Setting & Atmosphere (era, location, environment - LOCK to specific setting)
   - Character Archetype (if applicable - faceless mood doubles with exact physique/clothing/posture)
   - Emotional Tone (primary emotion and progression)
   - Cinematography (shot type, angles, lens, vignette){{#if themeColor}}
   - Incorporate {{themeColor}} as subtle accent{{/if}}
   
   CRITICAL: The Anchor Style must be GENERAL and apply to ALL events. DO NOT include specific event titles, event names, brand names, or event-specific content in the Anchor. For example, if the timeline is about TV history, describe the visual style for "television history" in general - do NOT mention "Netflix", "M*A*S*H", "Apollo 11", or other specific event titles. The Anchor should describe the overall aesthetic, NOT individual events.

2. For each event:
   - Description: 2-4 sentences narrating the scene
   - Image Prompt: Literal, recognizable scene. After generating anchorStyle, prepend a 60-80 character preview of it to each imagePrompt (e.g., "ANCHOR: [preview]. [scene description]")

CRITICAL: Descriptions and image prompts must describe the SAME scene/moment.
