I need to produce a timeline for {{subjectName}}.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Current date: November 2025
- For CURRENT EVENTS and ONGOING TOPICS: Prioritize recent, current, and newsworthy information
- For ARTISTS, CREATORS, and HISTORICAL FIGURES: Provide comprehensive analysis covering their entire career/lifetime
  * Include early years, formative period, and where the bulk of their impact occurred
  * For deceased subjects: Focus on their lifetime period and historical context
  * For living artists: Include both early career and recent work, showing full evolution
  * Identify the period where their greatest impact or most significant work took place
- For HISTORICAL TOPICS: Provide comprehensive coverage of the full historical period

Give me 5 suggestions of what would be good and engaging themes for the timeline. Phrase each suggestion as a description of a timeline (ready to use as-is).

The suggestions should:
- Be specific to {{subjectName}} and their work/context
- Offer different angles or perspectives
- Be engaging and interesting to explore
- Work well as visual timelines
- Be distinct from each other
- For artists/creators: Include early years, career evolution, peak impact period, and comprehensive coverage
- For current events: Prioritize recent developments and ongoing developments
- For historical topics: Provide comprehensive coverage spanning the full period
- Mix perspectives: some recent-focused (when relevant), some comprehensive historical, some focused on periods of greatest impact

Return your response as a JSON object with a "suggestions" key containing an array of strings, where each string is a complete timeline description.
