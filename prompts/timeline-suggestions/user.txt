I need to produce a timeline for {{subjectName}}.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Current date: November 2025
- Prioritize recent, current, and newsworthy information
- For topics with recent developments (e.g., recent qualifications, elections, achievements, breaking news), suggest timelines that capture the most recent and relevant events
- Recent events are often the most engaging - prioritize current information over older historical perspectives when both are available

Give me 5 suggestions of what would be good and engaging themes for the timeline. Phrase each suggestion as a description of a timeline (ready to use as-is).

The suggestions should:
- Be specific to {{subjectName}} and their work/context
- Offer different angles or perspectives
- Be engaging and interesting to explore
- Work well as visual timelines
- Be distinct from each other
- PRIORITIZE recent developments and current events when relevant to the topic
- For topics with ongoing or recent developments, emphasize the most current and newsworthy information

Return your response as a JSON object with a "suggestions" key containing an array of strings, where each string is a complete timeline description.

Example format for a recent topic (e.g., "Scotland World Cup qualifying"):
{
  "suggestions": [
    "Scotland's journey to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, including their recent qualification success in 2025 and the key matches and moments that secured their place.",
    "A comprehensive timeline of Scotland's World Cup qualifying campaigns from 2022 to 2025, highlighting their progression and recent achievement.",
    "The key moments and matches in Scotland's 2025 World Cup qualifying campaign, from the opening matches to their successful qualification.",
    "Scotland's World Cup history and their path to qualification, with emphasis on their recent 2025 qualification success.",
    "An analysis of Scotland's World Cup qualifying journey, focusing on the most recent campaign and their achievement of qualifying for the 2026 tournament."
  ]
}

Example format for historical/person topics:
{
  "suggestions": [
    "A biographical timeline of the key moments and milestones in their life and career.",
    "An overview of their public life, documenting their major achievements and significant events.",
    "A critical analysis of their impact and influence on their field and the wider culture.",
    "An examination of the key themes and patterns that have defined their work and legacy.",
    "A historical account of a significant event or period, and their central role within it."
  ]
}
