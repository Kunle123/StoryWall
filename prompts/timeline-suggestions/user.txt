I need to produce a timeline for {{subjectName}}.

Give me 5 suggestions of what would be good and engaging themes for the timeline. Phrase each suggestion as a description of a timeline (ready to use as-is).

The suggestions should:
- Be specific to {{subjectName}} and their work/context
- Offer different angles or perspectives
- Be engaging and interesting to explore
- Work well as visual timelines
- Be distinct from each other

Return your response as a JSON object with a "suggestions" key containing an array of strings, where each string is a complete timeline description.

Example format:
{
  "suggestions": [
    "A biographical timeline of the key moments and milestones in their life and career.",
    "An overview of their public life, documenting their major achievements and significant events.",
    "A critical analysis of their impact and influence on their field and the wider culture.",
    "An examination of the key themes and patterns that have defined their work and legacy.",
    "A historical account of a significant event or period, and their central role within it."
  ]
}
