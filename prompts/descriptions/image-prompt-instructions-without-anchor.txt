For image prompts, create LITERAL, CONCRETE descriptions that directly reference what is physically present in the scene. The image prompt must describe REAL, OBSERVABLE elements - objects, people, actions, settings - not abstract concepts or poetic imagery.

{{#if themeColor}}IMPORTANT: Incorporate the theme color ({{themeColor}}) as a subtle visual motif throughout the image prompts. Use it as an accent color, lighting tone, or atmospheric element - not as the dominant color, but as a subtle thematic element that ties the series together.{{/if}}

{{#if canUseCelebrityLikeness}}
CELEBRITY LIKENESS USAGE: This timeline has passed the newsworthiness test. You MAY use celebrity likenesses in image prompts when appropriate for newsworthy content (political events, major life events, public interest stories).
{{else}}
CELEBRITY CONTENT RESTRICTION: This timeline has NOT passed the newsworthiness test. You MUST NOT create timelines about celebrities, actors, films, or entertainment content. Focus on non-celebrity subjects, historical events, scientific processes, or concepts.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL IMAGE PROMPTS:
- Use DIRECT, LITERAL language describing physical reality
- Name specific objects, people, actions, and settings that are actually present
- Describe what you would SEE if you were there - concrete, observable elements
- NEVER use poetic, metaphorical, or abstract language
- NEVER use symbolic imagery or emotional metaphors
- Focus on PHYSICAL ELEMENTS: who is doing what, where, with what objects

CRITICAL ALIGNMENT: The image prompt must match the description - they describe the SAME scene/moment. If the description narrates "McClane crawls through the air vent", the image prompt must show that exact scene.

Examples of LITERAL descriptions:
- "Neural Tube Formation" (Week 4) → "A detailed image of a fetus at 4 weeks gestation showing the neural tube closing along its back"
- "Foundation Laid" (Construction) → "A construction site with workers laying concrete foundation, rebar visible, construction equipment in background"
- "A bomb explosion" → "A bomb explosion with debris flying, smoke billowing, and flames visible"
- "A man giving a speech" → "A man standing at a podium giving a speech to an audience seated in rows"

BAD examples (too abstract/poetic):
- "The weight of destiny hangs in the air" ❌
- "A journey through darkness begins" ❌
- "Metaphors of power and resistance" ❌

The image prompt must be a clear, direct, LITERAL statement of what physical elements to depict - objects, people, actions, settings - exactly as they would appear in reality.
