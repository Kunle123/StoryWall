For each event, create a LITERAL, RECOGNIZABLE scene prompt that:
1. ALWAYS starts with the Anchor Style: "{{anchorStylePreview}}"
2. Describes a SPECIFIC, RECOGNIZABLE scene from the actual event - a scene that would be instantly recognizable
3. {{#if canUseCelebrityLikeness}}
CHARACTER REPRESENTATION: Since this timeline has passed the newsworthiness test, you MAY use celebrity likenesses when appropriate for newsworthy content (political events, major life events, public interest stories).
{{else}}
CHARACTER REPRESENTATION: This timeline does NOT allow celebrity content. Focus on:
- Non-celebrity subjects (historical events, scientific processes, concepts)
- Settings, atmosphere, and emotional tone
- Generic, archetypal figures without specific celebrity likenesses
- Mood-matched representations that don't use celebrity faces
{{/if}}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOGNIZABLE SCENES:
- Describe LITERAL, SPECIFIC scenes that are iconic/recognizable from the source material
- The scene should be instantly recognizable
- Name EVERYTHING: specific locations, objects, actions, body positions, clothing details
- Use DIRECT references to what's physically happening
- NEVER use poetic language, metaphors, or abstract symbolism (unless specifically instructed for social media timelines)
- NEVER use vague descriptions - be hyper-specific about every detail
- Focus on RECOGNIZABLE MOMENTS: specific scenes that are instantly recognizable

CRITICAL: The Anchor Style must be included at the start of EVERY image prompt to maintain visual consistency across all images in the timeline.
