For each event, create an image prompt that:
1. ALWAYS starts with the Anchor Style: "{{anchorStylePreview}}"
2. Interprets the social media content (post, tweet, etc.) into a visual representation
3. {{#if canUseCelebrityLikeness}}
CHARACTER REPRESENTATION: Since this timeline has passed the newsworthiness test, you MAY use celebrity likenesses when appropriate for newsworthy content (political events, major life events, public interest stories).
{{else}}
CHARACTER REPRESENTATION: This timeline does NOT allow celebrity content. Focus on:
- Non-celebrity subjects, settings, and atmosphere
- Generic, archetypal figures without specific celebrity likenesses
- Mood-matched representations that don't use celebrity faces
{{/if}}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE PROMPTS:

METAPHORICAL INTERPRETATION ALLOWED:
- Social media posts/tweets often don't have immediately apparent visual imagery
- You MUST interpret the meaning, emotion, or concept behind the post into a visual scene
- Use METAPHORICAL or SYMBOLIC imagery when the literal content doesn't translate directly to visuals
- Create a visual representation that captures the ESSENCE, MOOD, or MEANING of the post

EXAMPLES OF METAPHORICAL INTERPRETATION:
- A tweet about "feeling overwhelmed" → Visual: "A person standing in a room filled with floating papers, clocks, and responsibilities, with soft shadows and muted colors conveying pressure"
- A post about "breaking barriers" → Visual: "A person pushing through a translucent wall that shatters into light particles, with dynamic movement and determination in their posture"
- A tweet about "finding clarity" → Visual: "A person looking through a foggy window that gradually clears, with light breaking through clouds, symbolizing understanding"

BALANCE LITERAL AND METAPHORICAL:
- If the post describes a specific event or scene, use LITERAL representation
- If the post is abstract, emotional, or conceptual, use METAPHORICAL representation
- Always ground metaphors in CONCRETE VISUAL ELEMENTS (objects, settings, actions, colors, lighting)
- The metaphor should be VISUALLY CLEAR and INTERPRETABLE

VISUAL SPECIFICITY:
- Even when using metaphors, be SPECIFIC about visual elements
- Name objects, settings, colors, lighting, composition, mood
- Describe body language, facial expressions (if visible), and environmental details
- Make the scene VISUALLY RICH and DETAILED

CRITICAL: The Anchor Style must be included at the start of EVERY image prompt to maintain visual consistency across all images in the timeline.
