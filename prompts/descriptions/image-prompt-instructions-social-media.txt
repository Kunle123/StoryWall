For each event, create an image prompt that:
1. ALWAYS starts with the Anchor Style: "{{anchorStylePreview}}"
2. Interprets the social media content (post, tweet, etc.) into a visual representation
3. {{#if canUseCelebrityLikeness}}
CHARACTER REPRESENTATION: Since this timeline has passed the newsworthiness test, you MAY use celebrity likenesses when appropriate for newsworthy content (political events, major life events, public interest stories).
{{else}}
CHARACTER REPRESENTATION: This timeline does NOT allow celebrity content. Focus on:
- Non-celebrity subjects, settings, and atmosphere
- Generic, archetypal figures without specific celebrity likenesses
- Mood-matched representations that don't use celebrity faces
{{/if}}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE PROMPTS:

METAPHORICAL INTERPRETATION ALLOWED:
- Social media posts/tweets often don't have immediately apparent visual imagery
- You MUST interpret the meaning, emotion, or concept behind the post into a visual scene
- Use METAPHORICAL or SYMBOLIC imagery when the literal content doesn't translate directly to visuals
- Create a visual representation that captures the ESSENCE, MOOD, or MEANING of the post

EXAMPLES OF METAPHORICAL INTERPRETATION:
- A tweet about "feeling overwhelmed" → Visual: "A person standing in a room filled with floating papers, clocks, and responsibilities, with soft shadows and muted colors conveying pressure"
- A post about "breaking barriers" → Visual: "A person pushing through a translucent wall that shatters into light particles, with dynamic movement and determination in their posture"
- A tweet about "finding clarity" → Visual: "A person looking through a foggy window that gradually clears, with light breaking through clouds, symbolizing understanding"

BALANCE LITERAL AND METAPHORICAL:
- If the post describes a specific event or scene, use LITERAL representation
- If the post is abstract, emotional, or conceptual, use METAPHORICAL representation
- Always ground metaphors in CONCRETE VISUAL ELEMENTS (objects, settings, actions, colors, lighting)
- The metaphor should be VISUALLY CLEAR and INTERPRETABLE

VISUAL SPECIFICITY:
- Even when using metaphors, be SPECIFIC about visual elements
- Name objects, settings, colors, lighting, composition, mood
- Describe body language, facial expressions (if visible), and environmental details
- Make the scene VISUALLY RICH and DETAILED

CRITICAL - PRESERVE CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE:
When describing people in image prompts, you MUST accurately preserve their core physical characteristics as they exist in reality:
- GENDER/SEX: If a person is male, describe them as male. If female, describe them as female. NEVER swap or misrepresent gender.
- RACE/ETHNICITY: Accurately describe the person's race/ethnicity (e.g., "Black", "White", "Asian", "Latino", "Middle Eastern", etc.). NEVER change a person's race or ethnicity.
- AGE: Describe the person's approximate age accurately (e.g., "young", "middle-aged", "elderly"). If a person is young, do not describe them as old, and vice versa.
- BODY TYPE: Accurately describe the person's body type (e.g., "thin", "slender", "average build", "overweight", "heavy-set"). If a person is thin, do not describe them as fat, and vice versa.

These characteristics are CORE to accurate representation and must be preserved exactly as they are in reality. When in doubt, research or use factual knowledge about the person's appearance.

CRITICAL: The Anchor Style must be included at the start of EVERY image prompt to maintain visual consistency across all images in the timeline.
