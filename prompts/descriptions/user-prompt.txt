Timeline Context: {{timelineDescription}}{{#if sourceRestrictions}}

SOURCE RESTRICTIONS - CRITICAL: You MUST source all information, descriptions, and titles SOLELY from the following specific resources. Do not use any other sources:
{{#each sourceRestrictions}}  {{@index}}. {{this}}
{{/each}}

If information is not available in these sources, indicate that in the event description.{{/if}}

{{#if imageContext}}{{imageContext}}

{{/if}}Generate descriptions and image prompts for these {{eventCount}} events:

{{#each events}}{{@index}}. {{year}}: {{title}}
{{/each}}

CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
- The DESCRIPTION explains the EVENT (what happened, why it matters, its historical/educational significance) - NOT what the scene looks like
- The IMAGE PROMPT describes the VISUAL SCENE (what you would see in an image of that event)
- They should be about the SAME event, but serve different purposes:
  * Description = explanation of the event's meaning, impact, and context
  * ImagePrompt = visual representation of what that event would look like
- Example: For "Invention of the Printing Press"
  * Description: "Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in the 15th century revolutionized the spread of information. This innovation made books affordable and accessible, breaking the monopoly of handwritten manuscripts."
  * ImagePrompt: "A 15th-century workshop with a wooden printing press, metal type blocks arranged in a case, a printer in period clothing operating the press"

CRITICAL FOR IMAGE PROMPTS: Each image prompt must describe a LITERAL, RECOGNIZABLE scene:

1. RECOGNIZABLE SCENES: Describe specific, iconic scenes that are instantly recognizable
2. HYPER-SPECIFIC DETAILS: Name EVERYTHING - locations, objects, actions, body positions, clothing details
3. DIRECT, CONCRETE LANGUAGE: What you would actually SEE if you were there

NEVER use poetic, metaphorical, or abstract language. Examples:
- BAD: "A journey through darkness", "The weight of destiny", "Metaphors of power"
- GOOD: "A man crawling through an air vent", "A bomb explosion with debris flying", "Workers laying concrete foundation"
