Timeline Context: {{timelineDescription}}{{#if sourceRestrictions}}

SOURCE RESTRICTIONS - CRITICAL: You MUST source all information, descriptions, and titles SOLELY from the following specific resources. Do not use any other sources:
{{#each sourceRestrictions}}  {{@index}}. {{this}}
{{/each}}

If information is not available in these sources, indicate that in the event description.{{/if}}

{{#if imageContext}}{{imageContext}}

{{/if}}Generate descriptions and image prompts for these {{eventCount}} events:

{{#each events}}{{@index}}. {{year}}: {{title}}
{{/each}}

CRITICAL ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENT:
- For EACH event, the DESCRIPTION and IMAGE PROMPT must describe the SAME SCENE/MOMENT
- The description narrates what's happening in that specific scene
- The image prompt describes what you would SEE in that exact same scene
- They must be perfectly aligned - do NOT create a description about one moment and an image prompt about a different moment

CRITICAL FOR IMAGE PROMPTS: Each image prompt must describe a LITERAL, RECOGNIZABLE scene:

1. RECOGNIZABLE SCENES: Describe specific, iconic scenes that are instantly recognizable
2. HYPER-SPECIFIC DETAILS: Name EVERYTHING - locations, objects, actions, body positions, clothing details
3. DIRECT, CONCRETE LANGUAGE: What you would actually SEE if you were there

NEVER use poetic, metaphorical, or abstract language. Examples:
- BAD: "A journey through darkness", "The weight of destiny", "Metaphors of power"
- GOOD: "A man crawling through an air vent", "A bomb explosion with debris flying", "Workers laying concrete foundation"
