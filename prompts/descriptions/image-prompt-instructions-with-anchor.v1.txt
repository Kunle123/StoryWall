For each event, create a LITERAL, RECOGNIZABLE scene prompt that:
1. ALWAYS starts with the Anchor Style: "{{anchorStylePreview}}"
2. Describes a SPECIFIC, RECOGNIZABLE scene from the actual event - a scene that would be instantly recognizable
3. {{#if canUseCelebrityLikeness}}
CHARACTER REPRESENTATION: Since this timeline has passed the newsworthiness test, you MAY use celebrity likenesses when appropriate for newsworthy content (political events, major life events, public interest stories).
{{else}}
CHARACTER REPRESENTATION: This timeline does NOT allow celebrity content. Focus on:
- Non-celebrity subjects (historical events, scientific processes, concepts)
- Settings, atmosphere, and emotional tone
- Generic, archetypal figures without specific celebrity likenesses
- Mood-matched representations that don't use celebrity faces
{{/if}}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOGNIZABLE SCENES:
- Describe LITERAL, SPECIFIC scenes that are iconic/recognizable from the source material
- The scene should be instantly recognizable
- Name EVERYTHING: specific locations, objects, actions, body positions, clothing details
- Use DIRECT references to what's physically happening
- NEVER use poetic language, metaphors, or abstract symbolism (unless specifically instructed for social media timelines)
- NEVER use vague descriptions - be hyper-specific about every detail
- Focus on RECOGNIZABLE MOMENTS: specific scenes that are instantly recognizable

CRITICAL - PRESERVE CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE:
When describing people in image prompts, you MUST accurately preserve their core physical characteristics as they exist in reality:
- GENDER/SEX: If a person is male, describe them as male. If female, describe them as female. NEVER swap or misrepresent gender.
- RACE/ETHNICITY: Accurately describe the person's race/ethnicity (e.g., "Black", "White", "Asian", "Latino", "Middle Eastern", etc.). NEVER change a person's race or ethnicity. YOU MUST EXPLICITLY STATE THE PERSON'S RACE/ETHNICITY IN THE IMAGE PROMPT - do not assume it will be inferred. For example: "Art Tatum, a Black pianist" or "a Black man playing piano" - the race must be explicitly mentioned in the prompt text.
- AGE: Describe the person's approximate age accurately (e.g., "young", "middle-aged", "elderly"). If a person is young, do not describe them as old, and vice versa.
- BODY TYPE: Accurately describe the person's body type (e.g., "thin", "slender", "average build", "overweight", "heavy-set"). If a person is thin, do not describe them as fat, and vice versa.

These characteristics are CORE to accurate representation and must be preserved exactly as they are in reality. When in doubt, research or use factual knowledge about the person's appearance.

MANDATORY: When an event involves a specific named person, the image prompt MUST explicitly state their race/ethnicity. Do not rely on the person's name alone - always include their race/ethnicity descriptor (e.g., "Black", "White", "Asian", etc.) in the prompt.

CRITICAL: The Anchor Style must be included at the start of EVERY image prompt to maintain visual consistency across all images in the timeline.
