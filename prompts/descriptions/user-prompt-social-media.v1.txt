SOURCE RESTRICTIONS - CRITICAL: You MUST source all information, descriptions, and titles SOLELY from the following specific resources. Do not use any other sources:
{{#each sourceRestrictions}}  {{@index}}. {{this}}
{{/each}}

If information is not available in these sources, indicate that in the event description.{{/if}}

{{#if imageContext}}{{imageContext}}

{{/if}}Generate descriptions and image prompts for these {{eventCount}} social media posts/tweets:

{{#each events}}{{@index}}. {{year}}: {{title}}
{{/each}}

CRITICAL DISTINCTION FOR SOCIAL MEDIA:
- The DESCRIPTION explains the POST/TWEET (what it says, its context, significance, and why it matters) - NOT what the scene looks like
- The IMAGE PROMPT describes the VISUAL REPRESENTATION (which may be metaphorical if the post doesn't have literal imagery)
- They should be about the SAME content, but serve different purposes:
  * Description = explanation of the post's meaning, context, and impact
  * ImagePrompt = visual representation that interprets the post's essence, emotion, or meaning

METAPHORICAL INTERPRETATION FOR IMAGE PROMPTS:
- Social media posts often don't have immediately apparent visual imagery
- You MUST interpret the meaning, emotion, or concept behind the post into a visual scene
- Use METAPHORICAL or SYMBOLIC imagery when the literal content doesn't translate directly to visuals
- Always ground metaphors in CONCRETE VISUAL ELEMENTS (objects, settings, actions, colors, lighting, composition)
- Be SPECIFIC about visual details even when using metaphors

CRITICAL FOR IMAGE PROMPTS:
1. INTERPRET THE ESSENCE: Capture the meaning, emotion, or concept of the post
2. VISUAL SPECIFICITY: Name specific objects, settings, colors, lighting, composition, mood
3. METAPHORICAL WHEN NEEDED: Use metaphors for abstract or emotional content, but make them visually concrete
4. LITERAL WHEN POSSIBLE: If the post describes a specific scene, use literal representation
