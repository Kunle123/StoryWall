{{imagePromptInstructions}}

{{#if canUseCelebrityLikeness}}
CELEBRITY LIKENESS USAGE: This timeline has passed the newsworthiness test. You MAY use celebrity likenesses in image prompts when appropriate, as this project is newsworthy, transformative, and protected under Fair Use and Right of Publicity exceptions for informational/commentary purposes.
{{else}}
CELEBRITY CONTENT RESTRICTION: This timeline has NOT passed the newsworthiness test. You MUST NOT create timelines about celebrities, actors, films, or entertainment content unless it is clearly newsworthy (e.g., political events, major life events, public interest stories). Focus on non-celebrity subjects, historical events, scientific processes, or concepts.
{{/if}}

CRITICAL ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENT:
- The DESCRIPTION and IMAGE PROMPT must describe the SAME SCENE/MOMENT
- The description should narrate what's happening in the scene
- The image prompt should describe what you would SEE in that exact same scene
- They must be perfectly aligned - if the description says "The president signs the bill", the image prompt must show that exact moment
- Do NOT create descriptions about one moment and image prompts about a different moment

CRITICAL: Image prompts must describe LITERAL, RECOGNIZABLE scenes:

1. RECOGNIZABLE: Specific, iconic scenes that are instantly recognizable
2. HYPER-SPECIFIC: Name EVERYTHING - locations, objects, actions, body positions, clothing details
3. DIRECT & CONCRETE: What you would actually SEE - no poetry, no metaphors, no abstract symbolism

BAD (poetic/abstract): "A journey through darkness", "The weight of destiny", "Metaphors of power"
BAD (vague): "A man giving a speech"
GOOD (literal & recognizable): "A man standing at a wooden podium in a grand hall, addressing a seated audience in formal attire. The hall has high ceilings, ornate columns, and large windows. The man's posture is upright and confident, one hand resting on the podium, the other gesturing outward."

Return both as a JSON object with "descriptions" and "imagePrompts" arrays, each containing exactly {{eventCount}} items.
