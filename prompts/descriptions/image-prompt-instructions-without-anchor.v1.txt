For image prompts, create LITERAL, CONCRETE descriptions that directly reference what is physically present in the scene. The image prompt must describe REAL, OBSERVABLE elements - objects, people, actions, settings - not abstract concepts or poetic imagery.

{{#if themeColor}}IMPORTANT: Incorporate the theme color ({{themeColor}}) as a subtle visual motif throughout the image prompts. Use it as an accent color, lighting tone, or atmospheric element - not as the dominant color, but as a subtle thematic element that ties the series together.{{/if}}

{{#if canUseCelebrityLikeness}}
CELEBRITY LIKENESS USAGE: This timeline has passed the newsworthiness test. You MAY use celebrity likenesses in image prompts when appropriate for newsworthy content (political events, major life events, public interest stories).
{{else}}
CELEBRITY CONTENT RESTRICTION: This timeline has NOT passed the newsworthiness test. You MUST NOT create timelines about celebrities, actors, films, or entertainment content. Focus on non-celebrity subjects, historical events, scientific processes, or concepts.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL IMAGE PROMPTS:
- Use DIRECT, LITERAL language describing physical reality
- Name specific objects, people, actions, and settings that are actually present
- Describe what you would SEE if you were there - concrete, observable elements
- NEVER use poetic, metaphorical, or abstract language
- NEVER use symbolic imagery or emotional metaphors
- Focus on PHYSICAL ELEMENTS: who is doing what, where, with what objects

CRITICAL - PRESERVE CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE:
When describing people in image prompts, you MUST accurately preserve their core physical characteristics as they exist in reality:
- GENDER/SEX: If a person is male, describe them as male. If female, describe them as female. NEVER swap or misrepresent gender.
- RACE/ETHNICITY: Accurately describe the person's race/ethnicity (e.g., "Black", "White", "Asian", "Latino", "Middle Eastern", etc.). NEVER change a person's race or ethnicity.
- AGE: Describe the person's approximate age accurately (e.g., "young", "middle-aged", "elderly"). If a person is young, do not describe them as old, and vice versa.
- BODY TYPE: Accurately describe the person's body type (e.g., "thin", "slender", "average build", "overweight", "heavy-set"). If a person is thin, do not describe them as fat, and vice versa.

These characteristics are CORE to accurate representation and must be preserved exactly as they are in reality. When in doubt, research or use factual knowledge about the person's appearance.

CRITICAL ALIGNMENT: The image prompt must match the description - they describe the SAME scene/moment.

The image prompt must be a clear, direct, LITERAL statement of what physical elements to depict - objects, people, actions, settings - exactly as they would appear in reality. NEVER use poetic, metaphorical, or abstract language unless specifically instructed for social media timelines.
