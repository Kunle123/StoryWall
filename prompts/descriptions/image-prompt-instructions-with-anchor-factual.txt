For each event, create a LITERAL, CONCRETE image prompt that:
1. ALWAYS starts with the Anchor Style: "{{anchorStylePreview}}"
2. Accurately depicts the Factual Details for that specific stage (provided below)
3. Describes LITERAL, PHYSICAL elements - what objects, actions, and people are actually present in the scene

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use DIRECT, CONCRETE language describing what is physically happening in the scene
- Name specific objects, actions, and physical elements
- Describe LITERAL scenes from the actual event - what you would see if you were there
- NEVER use poetic, metaphorical, or abstract language
- NEVER use symbolic imagery or emotional metaphors
- Focus on PHYSICAL REALITY: who is doing what, where, with what objects

CRITICAL - PRESERVE CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE:
When describing people in image prompts, you MUST accurately preserve their core physical characteristics as they exist in reality:
- GENDER/SEX: If a person is male, describe them as male. If female, describe them as female. NEVER swap or misrepresent gender.
- RACE/ETHNICITY: Accurately describe the person's race/ethnicity (e.g., "Black", "White", "Asian", "Latino", "Middle Eastern", etc.). NEVER change a person's race or ethnicity.
- AGE: Describe the person's approximate age accurately (e.g., "young", "middle-aged", "elderly"). If a person is young, do not describe them as old, and vice versa.
- BODY TYPE: Accurately describe the person's body type (e.g., "thin", "slender", "average build", "overweight", "heavy-set"). If a person is thin, do not describe them as fat, and vice versa.

These characteristics are CORE to accurate representation and must be preserved exactly as they are in reality. When in doubt, research or use factual knowledge about the person's appearance.

Keep prompts concise - the event-specific details should be the focus. The Anchor provides visual consistency but shouldn't dominate the prompt.
