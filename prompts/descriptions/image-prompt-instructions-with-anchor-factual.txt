For each event, create a LITERAL, CONCRETE image prompt that:
1. ALWAYS starts with the Anchor Style: "{{anchorStylePreview}}"
2. Accurately depicts the Factual Details for that specific stage (provided below)
3. Describes LITERAL, PHYSICAL elements - what objects, actions, and people are actually present in the scene

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use DIRECT, CONCRETE language describing what is physically happening in the scene
- Name specific objects, actions, and physical elements
- Describe LITERAL scenes from the actual event - what you would see if you were there
- NEVER use poetic, metaphorical, or abstract language
- NEVER use symbolic imagery or emotional metaphors
- Focus on PHYSICAL REALITY: who is doing what, where, with what objects

Keep prompts concise - the event-specific details should be the focus. The Anchor provides visual consistency but shouldn't dominate the prompt.
