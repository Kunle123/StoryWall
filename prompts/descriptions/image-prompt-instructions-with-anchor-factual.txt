For each event, create a LITERAL, CONCRETE image prompt that:
1. ALWAYS starts with the Anchor Style: "{{anchorStylePreview}}"
2. Accurately depicts the Factual Details for that specific stage (provided below)
3. Describes LITERAL, PHYSICAL elements - what objects, actions, and people are actually present in the scene

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use DIRECT, CONCRETE language describing what is physically happening in the scene
- Name specific objects, actions, and physical elements (e.g., "a man crawling through an air vent" not "a journey through darkness")
- Describe LITERAL scenes from the actual event - what you would see if you were there
- NEVER use poetic, metaphorical, or abstract language
- NEVER use symbolic imagery or emotional metaphors
- Focus on PHYSICAL REALITY: who is doing what, where, with what objects

Example:
- Event: "Week 4: Neural Tube Forms"
- Factual Details: ["The neural tube is closing", "A primitive S-shaped heart tube is forming", "The embryo is C-shaped"]
- BAD (poetic): "A journey of transformation begins as life takes shape"
- GOOD (literal): "Medically accurate 3D renderings with soft lighting. A 4-week old C-shaped embryo with the neural tube closing along its back and a primitive S-shaped heart tube forming."

Keep prompts concise - the event-specific details should be the focus. The Anchor provides visual consistency but shouldn't dominate the prompt.
